## 🚀 How It Works
Of course, we can't _actually_ download RAM (if only, right?). This website is designed as a fun, tongue-in-cheek nod to the old internet joke about downloading more RAM. It's a neat way to play a harmless prank or just share a laugh with tech-savvy friends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
